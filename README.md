# Space-Wars
Original single or multiplayer space wars game with scrolling background, stimulating music, and enemy AI. Destroy asteroids, shoot up enemy ships, and defeat bosses!

Thank you for checking out my game, Space Wars. This is a personal project I decided to begin to gain a little more comfort before putting my own Game Engine together and also because I found that I have to be creative to be content. Building my own projects has allowed me to be original in design and implementation. Using the knowledge of building full applications along with the many resources available to me, including the stack overflow community, I developed this game from the ground up. Most of the code is reusable and I am working on a separate game developmenttemplate using said code and additional objects. The template is nearly finished and will be uploaded to github soon. Space Wars, which was renamed to Space Case, is a 2D shooter developed using the JavaFX library and Java 9. JetBrains IntelliJ was used to compile this project.


Running the application:
At the moment, the game can be run in IntelliJ and maybe Netbeans. Clone the package and open as a new project, then run Main class.

Controls:
The game is two player until I finished the start menu, so below are the controls for each player. Sorry for that. It is being updated.

Player 1:
W - UP
A - LEFT
S - DOWN
D - RIGHT
SHIFT - FIRE

Player 2:
UP arrow - UP
LEFT arrow - LEFT
DOWN arrow - DOWN
RIGHT arrow - you guessed it, RIGHT
COMMA - FIRE

ESCAPE - PAUSE/RESUME Game
